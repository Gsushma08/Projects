        <o1>
            <li>Marinate the chicken</li>
            <p>In a large bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice. Allow it to marinate for at least 1-2 hours, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
            <pre>
                - Rinse the soaked basmati rice under cold water.
                - In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt, bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick.
                - Add the rinsed rice and cook until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set aside.
            </pre>
            <br>
            <li>Prepare Biryani Masala:</li>
            <pre>
                - In a large pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.
                - Add cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Once they splutter, add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.
                - Add ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
                - Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biryani masala. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil separates.
                - Add marinated chicken and cook until it's partially cooked.
            </pre>
            <br>
            <li>Layering and Dum Cooking:</li>
            <pre>
                - In a heavy-bottomed pan or biryani pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice.
                - Sprinkle chopped mint leaves and cilantro over the rice layer.
                - Add the remaining chicken masala over the rice layer.
                - Top it with the rest of the partially cooked rice.
                - Garnish with fried onions and a few mint leaves.
                - Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook completely.
            </pre>
            <br>
            <li>Serve:</li>

                - Serve hot with raita (yogurt side dish) or a simple cucumber and mint salad.
